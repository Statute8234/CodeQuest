# Rating

For its readability, modularity, and error handling. It is well-structured and easy to follow, with each function having a clear purpose and descriptive variable names. The code is divided into functions, promoting modularity and reusability. However, there are areas for improvement, such as minimizing global variables, reducing code duplication, using named constants for magic numbers, improving user interaction, separating win condition logic into its own function or class, and enhancing input validation.
Additionally, the code could be more robust in input validation, such as checking for invalid furniture selections. Adding comments to explain complex logic or game mechanics would also improve the code's readability, especially for developers maintaining or extending the game. By addressing these areas, the code can enhance its clarity, maintainability, and user experience.
